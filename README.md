 'pandas' is essential for loading, cleaning, and transforming data. It helps in understanding the structure and content of your dataset, identifying missing values, and performing initial data wrangling.
â€¢  Data Visualization:
 'matplotlib.pyplot' is a fundamental plotting library that allows you to create a wide range of static, animated, and interactive visualizations. Visualization helps in identifying patterns, trends, and outliers in your data, which are crucial for generating insights and guiding further analysis.
